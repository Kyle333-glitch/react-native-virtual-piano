## Answers to Hack Cider form questions

### How did you hear about this?
I discovered this program while browsing the Hack Club homepage, where it was featured and caught my attention.

### What are we doing well?
- Removing Apple Developer Membership paywall
- Helping getting app on TestFlight
- Motivation through rewards
- Visibility in submissions gallery

### How can we improve?
- Not everyone can finish an app in just 30 days, which leads to rushed results.
- The vast majority of people don't have a Mac to code in SwiftUI and Swift.
- Even if you use React Native, you can't plug in an iPhone to test the app.
- You need a mac for an iOS Simulator, so every time you want to test your app, you have to keep a physical device with you with Expo Go, which only has a limited set of native modules.
- No Instruments Profiler, can't see CPU usage, memory allocation, battery impact, frame rates, etc. 
- Submissions gallery isn't working: "Error loading submissions. Please try again later. You are not authorized to perform this operation"
